Dear,

I just provided you the access to our Yoda folder that contains PCR-GLOBWB output files from the 5 arcmin global run made for the GMD paper (Sutanudjaja et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2429-2018).

- Please activate your Yoda account by following the instructions given in an email automatically generated/sent by Yoda. 

- After you activate your account, you should be able to access the folder https://geo.data.uu.nl/research-pcrglobwb/pcr-globwb_gmd_paper_sutanudjaja_et_al_2018/rerun_201903XX/output/05min/netcdf/monthly/ 

- Please check the "README.TXT" file on the folder to get some information about the files, https://geo.data.uu.nl/research-pcrglobwb/pcr-globwb_gmd_paper_sutanudjaja_et_al_2018/rerun_201903XX/output/05min/netcdf/monthly/README.TXT.txt 

I hope that the files are useful, and this information is clear.  

Best, 

Edwin
