1) water withdrawals from the domestic, industrial and irrigation sectors
- totalAbstraction_annuaTot_output
- domesticWaterWithdrawal_annuaTot_output
- industryWaterWithdrawal_annuaTot_output
- irrigation sector withdrawal (inclucing livestock): totalAbstraction - (domesticWaterWithdrawal + industryWaterWithdrawal)

2) domestic and industrial return flows (needed to be calculated from monthly values as return flow fraction changes over time)
- domestic return flow_annua = sum( monthly_domestic_fraction * domesticWaterWithdrawal_monthTot)
- industry_retun_flow_annua = sum( monthly_industry_fraction * industryWaterWithdrawal_monthTot )
